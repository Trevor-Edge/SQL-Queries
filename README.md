# SQL-Queries

Each file is a group of SQL queries used to gather information from different databases during my SQL class. The difficulty in these queries ranges from easy to moderately complex.
This class consisted of 4 labs, a practice test, a formal exam, and a refresher exam after the class had ended to sharpen our skills.
